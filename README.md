# SOAP hands on

*   SOAP is a web standard.
*   SOAP stands for Simple Object Access protocol
*   SOAP uses HTTP protocol for data transfer. Can use other protocol like SMTP, UDP, etc.
*   SOAP uses XML for all the messages.
*   SOAP is language, platform and transport independent.

Ways to access SOAP web-service
*  Service provider knows the client - Service provider sends WSDL to client so client can access the service available on WSDL
*  Service provider registers WSDL to UDDI and client can access it from UDDI - Service provider registers with UDDI, client searches for service in UDDI.
